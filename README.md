# Column Challenge

First, clone this repository.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/miguel-nascimento/column-challenge.git
```

Install dependencies with Yarn.

```console
$ yarn
```

I know, the installation of dependencies take a time, use this time to install Expo app in Playstore or App Store.

Now, use yarn start to run Expo.

```console
$ yarn start
```

Great! Now you only need to scam the QR Code. ðŸ˜‰
